# ==================================================
# ============== COUNT DW WITH PAUSE  ==============
# ==================================================
# 
# ------------------------------------------------
# STEP1: TIMER CONFIGRUATION
# At time 200, pause_after_n_cycles is 36
# At time 200, write TCR to start timer with clk2
# At 201 Start writing wdata = 8'h30 to address = 8'h1
# At 281 Write Transfer has been finished
# ------------------------------------
# STEP 2: Pause timer after 36 cycles
# At time 281, wait for 36 cycles
# At time 1720, write TCR to pause timer
# At 1741 Start writing wdata = 8'h0 to address = 8'h1
# At 1821 Write Transfer has been finished
# At time 2021, write TCR to start timer again
# At 2041 Start writing wdata = 8'h30 to address = 8'h1
# At 2121 Write Transfer has been finished
# ------------------------------------
# STEP 3: Wait for timer to finish counting
# At time 2121, wait for 220 cycles
# ------------------------------------
# STEP 4: Check TSR
# At time 10920, after 220 clk_int, read TSR
# At 10941 Start reading data at  address = 8'h2
# At 11021 Read Transfer has been finished
# At time 11021, TSR = 8'h2, UNDERFLOW --PASS--
# 
# -------------------------------------------------
# STEP 5: CLEAR TSR AND DOUBLE CHECK TSR
# At time 11021, clear TSR
# At 11041 Start writing wdata = 8'h0 to address = 8'h2
# At 11121 Write Transfer has been finished
# At time 11121, read TSR
# At 11141 Start reading data at  address = 8'h2
# At 11221 Read Transfer has been finished
# At time 11221, TSR = 8'h0
# BIT UNDERFLOW CLEARED --PASS--
